Instructions:

Make sure the src file(*.zip) is already extracted to a local working directory(e.g c:\bowling)

To build, run the following command at the command prompt:

c:\bowling>build.bat


For quick test, run the command below. `run.bat` file executes 

c:\bowling>run.bat


Alternatively, you can run 

c:\bowling>java -jar target/alltej-bowling-1.0.0.jar input.txt


The app will display results in the console.
